# Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System

## Project Overview

The **Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline academic course enrollment and learning management. The system allows students to create accounts, browse available courses, enroll in courses, access course materials, track their learning progress, and receive updates regarding their courses.

The application also provides administrators with tools to manage students, courses, enrollments, and progress reports.

This project demonstrates key concepts in Full Stack Web Development, including frontend development, backend APIs, database management, authentication, deployment, and application security.
